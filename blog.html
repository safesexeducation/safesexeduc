<h2>The Causes and Effects of Unsafe Sex</h2>

<h2>Causes:</h2>
<p><strong>Conformity in one's group of friends / Peer pressure:</strong> 
- According to Espenida's experience, her friend has been engaging in unsafe sex practices due to feeling left out. Her friend isn't included in his group's other circle of friends. In this group, they share sex videos with each other. To be part of the group chat, she feels she must also engage in such behavior with her boyfriend.
</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Alcohol/Drugs:</strong> 
- According to Study.com, substance abuse, including alcohol and drugs, can significantly impair the brain's decision-making faculties, compromising judgment in various areas, particularly sexual behavior.
</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Media:</strong> 
- Based on Study.com, modern media, such as television and film, frequently expose individuals, including children, to a myriad of sexualized content. Without appropriate adult guidance, children may struggle to comprehend and interpret these messages, potentially leading to confusion and misunderstanding.
</p>

<h2>Effects:</h2>
                <p><strong>1. Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)</strong>

 -Unsafe sex significantly increases the risk of contracting bacterial and viral STIs such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, HIV, herpes, and HPV. These infections can lead to serious health complications, including infertility, chronic pain, organ damage, and cancer. 
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>2. Unintended Pregnancy</strong>

- Engaging in sexual activity without effective contraception may result in unplanned pregnancies, often leading to emotional, social, and financialu stress. 
                    <br><br>
                   <strong>3. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID)</strong>

-Unsafe sexual practices can lead to infections that progress to PID, which can cause chronic pelvic pain, infertility, and ectopic pregnancies.
                </p>
                <br>

                <p><strong>4. Mental and Emotional Consequences</strong>

-Diagnosis with an STI or dealing with unplanned pregnancy can lead to anxiety, depression, and strained relationships due to stigma or lack of support.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>5. Social and Financial Impact</strong>

-Individuals may face judgment or discrimination, and managing health issues like chronic STIs or raising an unplanned child can lead to significant financial burdens.
